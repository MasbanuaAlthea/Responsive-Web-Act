            <p> My name is Althea Lyn Masbanua, but you can call me Teys. I'm a 19 years old, 
                first-year Computer Science student at the City of Malabon University.
                 Although I might look younger than my age, I'm filled with youthful energy and 
                 a passion for learning.
                 <br> 
                 Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy indulging in various hobbies.  
                 I find solace in losing myself in a good book, especially those that transport 
                 me to different worlds. When I need a break from studying, I often turn to movies, 
                 particularly horror films, which I find both thrilling and captivating.
                 </br>

                 <br>
                Baking is another passion of mine. I love experimenting with different 
                flavors and techniques, and the satisfaction of creating something delicious from 
                scratch is truly rewarding. Music is also a significant part of my life. I find it 
                incredibly calming and inspiring, often listening to it while studying or simply 
                relaxing.
                </br>
                <br>
                While I may struggle with the challenges of my Computer Science course, 
                I'm determined to persevere. The unwavering support of my family, friends,
                 and, most importantly, my loving partner has been instrumental in keeping me 
                 motivated. I'm grateful for their encouragement and believe that with hard work 
                 and dedication, I can overcome any obstacle.
                </br>
                <br>
                I'm excited to embrace the future, filled with both opportunities and uncertainties.

                grow, not just by supporting me, but by encouraging me to be the best version of 
                myself. Whether it's offering words of encouragement when I feel uncertain or simply 
                listening when I need to talk, he has a way of making me feel heard, understood,
